## Features

- **Fast File Downloads**: Quickly download files or directories from remote servers connected via SSH directly to your local machine.
- **Multiple File Selection**: Supports downloading multiple files or directories simultaneously.
- **Rsync-Based Transfers**: Utilizes `rsync` for optimized and reliable synchronization between remote servers and your local machine.
- **Automatic Rsync Installation and Version Check**: Automatically checks if `rsync` is installed and up-to-date on your local machine, providing guidance for installation or updates.
- **Passwordless SSH Authentication Detection**: Detects if passwordless SSH authentication is not set up and provides clear instructions for configuration.

## Benefits

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Uses `rsync`'s differential transfer capability, ensuring only changed files are copied, making downloads faster and more efficient.
- **Seamless Workflow**: Download files directly from the **VSCode Explorer context menu** without switching to external tools like FileZilla.
- **Enhanced Security**: Encourages the use of SSH keys for passwordless authentication, improving security while reducing the hassle of entering passwords.

1. **Visual Studio Code**: Version **1.60.0** or higher.
2. **Remote SSH Extension**: The official **VSCode Remote - SSH** extension for connecting to remote servers.
3. **Rsync**: Installed on both the local and remote machines.
   - **MacOS**: Ensure `rsync` version **3.0.0** or higher is installed (the default version on macOS is outdated).
4. **Passwordless SSH Authentication**: Configure SSH key-based authentication for seamless operation.
